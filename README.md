# isup
A tool to check whether a given url is up or not.

Currently only works with plain json requests, ie. "!up reddit.com"

~~If there's some other kind of formatting, ie. "!up <'http:\/\/google.com|google.com>", it'll fail.~~

TODO:
~~* Find a way to strip formatting to bare text.~~ 

Thanks to /u/m3lkor001 at /r/learnpython for helping me to solve the parsin issue.
