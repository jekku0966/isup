A tool to check whether a given url is up or not.

I have no previous python coding experience except codecademy.com python course. I think I did a pretty good job on doing this.



~~Currently only works with plain json requests, ie. "!up reddit.com"~~

~~If there's some other kind of formatting, ie. "!up <'http:\/\/google.com|google.com>", it'll fail.~~

TODO:
~~* Find a way to strip formatting to bare text.~~ 
* Find a way to check Slack Outgoing webhook Content-Type to make this actually work as it should.

Thanks to /u/m3lkor001 at /r/learnpython for helping me to solve the parsing issue. 

### TODO:
* Streamline the code for faster response (duh)
* ????
* Profit
